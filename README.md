# OBS-text-changer
randomly changes a text in a file that will change text on OBS if selected as output

OBS has a setting in the text that displays text from a file. when its selected the "stream.txt" it will change when the program is running.
what you want to be randomly said goes in "options.txt", it picks by line. text after the (#) will not be put in the "stream.txt" file, it will be output to the console though. its also there as an ability to comment.
